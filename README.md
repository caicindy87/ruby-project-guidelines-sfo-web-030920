# Spontaneous Plans

## Intro
Spontaneous Plans is a CLI application created with the idea of making it easier to enjoy a spontaneous day in any given location. This application was made possible with the help of the Yelp API. Spontaneous Plans allows users to quickly see nearby locations by entering the user’s current location address. The app will reveal five business names at a time and allow users to save the locations that users might enjoy.
